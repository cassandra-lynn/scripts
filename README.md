# lizardthunder/scripts
a set of little helper scripts i use to make life easier. very hacky. most use bash.
# scripts i use
 * noDesktopd.sh, noDownloadsd - two small "daemons" that wait for some program to make a ~/Desktop or ~/Downloads directory and immediately remove that new directory. both are hacky fixes for firefox.
 * poweroff, reboot, powerd - i like normally power off and reboot from a terminal in X, but i also like to see openrc's shutdown process as it happens. this lets me do both.
 * fuck - for those days when nothing is going right
# defunct scripts
 * whatalsa.sh - a script that prints the process bound to alsa
 * wifi.sh - a small wrapper for wpa_supplicant and iw, for managing wifi connections
 * tmpmnt.sh - an unfinished script that was supposed to make a temporary mounting point in ~ for mounting USBs, etc, so i didn't have to make a ~/USBx directory.
 * brownstonescraper.sh - gets all of the floor plans for the BU Brownstones that aren't specialty houses. an attempt to make the BU housing process a bit less of a pain (it didn't help)
